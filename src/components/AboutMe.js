                    <h4>I am currently working as a design engineer.
                        A year ago, I discovered a new hobby â€“ programming.
                        I completed the HTML/CSS course, read the book "The Big Book of CSS" by David McFarland, "JavaScript for Kids" by Nick Morgan. Then, I took a course on JavaScript 2.0 by Alexander Lushchenko as well as a course on NodeJs.
                        I am very impressed with this area, and I want to do it on an ongoing basis and develop as a professional.
                        For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their junior front-end developers. I would be happy to demonstrate my professional potential.
                        In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a friendly addition to your team.
